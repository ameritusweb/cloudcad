- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Real-time 3D rendering powered by Babylon.js.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed structural analysis reports.
- **Export and Import Capabilities**: Custom JSON format and standard CAD formats support.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive controls for both CAD operations and structural analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- Python (v3.8 or later)
- CalculiX (for structural analysis)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloudcad.git
   cd cloudcad
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd ../backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add necessary variables (see `.env.example`).

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
